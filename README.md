# 👋 Hi there! I'm Bogdan

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm a Master's student in **Computer Science – Artificial Intelligence, Data Analysis, and Data Science**.  
I love to explore, learn, and—whenever I can—explain this fascinating world of code, data, and insight 💡

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- 📚 Studying **AI, Machine Learning, Data Science**, and everything that lies between code and the real world.
- 🧠 Currently developing an educational course to explain complex ideas in simple terms. If that sounds interesting, **stay tuned**!
- ✍️ I enjoy writing, sharing ideas, and diving into personal projects.
